# guessing_game
Here's a classic programming problem for beginners: a guessing game. Here's how it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then ask the player to enter a guess. After you enter an assumption, the program will indicate whether the assumption is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
